There are three rounds in the quiz. Each round can be toggled either through the round toggle or after finishing all the questions in the existing round. Images for the quiz aren't provided here. You can add the questions and answers to the system by simply keeping the questions images in a folder - Example - "quiz_question_images_round1" and answers in "quiz_answer_images_round1".

Follow the format of the quiz question images and answers just like in the given images 'qns'&'ans'.
